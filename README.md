ids-sensor-packaging
====================

These are rough Debian packaging materials and diffs to official Debian 
packaging materials to allow me to maintain a `pf_ring`-based IDS sensor 
collection.

For `pf_ring` and friends: just copy the `pf_ring/debian` directory in place, 
create a changelog entry for the version you're working with and you're ready
to go.

For `bro`: just copy the `bro/debian` directory into place, create a changelog
entry for the version you're working with and you're ready to go.

For `suricata`: just copy the `suricata/debian` directory into place, create a
changelog entry for the version you're working with and you're ready to go.
The debian directory is derived from the Debian official one and should work
for any 1.4.x variant.
